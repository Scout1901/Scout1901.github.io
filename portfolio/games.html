            <h4>Description:</h4>

            <p>An interactive behavioral assessment where middle school students navigate an after-school program and make 
                decisions that test their social skills.</p>

            <h4>My Role:</h4>

            <p>I worked as the primary narrative writer on this project, teaming up with prosocial
                behavioral experts to design a story and dialogue that would feel realistic to middle schoolers, 
                incorporate fun, interactive activities, and test students' ability to have positive social interactions. Additionally,
                I created storyboards and character profiles for the developers and artists.

            <h4>Description:</h4>

            <p>Students are placed in the role of junior scientists tasked with colonizing an alien planet, WAT247.
                They must explore uncharted lands and learn about the planet's water systems to solve mysteries and pave the way 
                for survival. Throughout gameplay, students gain an understanding of the role of water in socio-ecological systems & how to build a convincing 
                scientific argument.
            </p>
            
            <h4>My Role:</h4>

            <p>I aided in the re-design of Mission Hydrosci to better meet the needs of students and educators. My primary role was as
                a consultant to ensure curriculum alignment and aid in improving the game design to more effectively meet science 
                learning goals. I also assisted in re-designing teacher documentation to enable educators to more effectively implement the 
                game into their classrooms.

            <h4>Description:</h4>

            <p>This simulation is an expansion of an existing Adroit project that provides undergraduate students
                with the opportunity to virtually manage a coffee shop. In the original simulation, students must manage store
                inventory, set prices, create employee schedules, and more to successfully turn a profit. The human
                resources expansion seeks to give students the opportunity to interview and hire employees, manage common
                personelle issues, and encounter the social aspects of running a business. 
            </p>

            <h4>My Role:</h4>

            <p>I worked to create the initial storyboards and user interface for this project. Additionally, I created
            extensive character profiles and outline narrative developments for gameplay.

            <p>An solo project created using Construct 3 for a graduate level course in game design.</p>

            <p>Fossil Quest is a simulation style game that invites players to journey through time and help preserve a
                rare dinosaur for future generations. Fossil Quest seeks to enhance players' cognitive skills through the application of rules-based
                knowledge. Simulated role play and examples are used to teach players the conceptual relationship
                between factors that affect fossilization (such as oxygen, pressure, environment, and specimen
                composition) and the preservation of a specimen.

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>A group project created using Construct 3 for a graduate level course game design. My contributions to this project
               included prototype development, aligning assessment methods with learning objectives, and conceptual design assistance. 
            </p>

            <p>Geo-Holo is a serious game that will help to reinforce the learning objectives presented in an introductory 
                level undergraduate geology course at the University of Missouri. 
               Four learning objectives were identified by our faculty client 
                and our team worked to develop a game to engage learners in exploring these objectives. In Geo-Holo, 
                players are tasked with collecting dinosaur fossils for a new museum using futuristic technology. 
                In the process, the players will learn about basic geologic principles.
