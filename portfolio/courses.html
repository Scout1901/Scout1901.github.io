            <p>This project was created using Adobe Captivate as part of a course entitled Rapid Development Tools for Learning. It was an 
            individual project in which I was the sole contributor.

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
            <p class="main_link">This artifact aligns with LTD program goal #1 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objectives 1.1-1.3)</strong></a> because it demonstrates the ability to create a learning experience that promotes student engagement 
                and interaction while utilizing project management skills. This project was challenging to complete for several reasons, the most impactful of which was the time constraints. 
                Learning to use Adobe Captivate under the pressure
                of a free trial meant that I had to stay organized and motivated to complete my work. I found that creating the 
                astronomy content from scatch provided additional difficulties when trying to stick to a schedule. To mitigate these difficulties
                I worked to prioritize the most important parts of the course first and then proceeded to add in additional features
                like music and animations as I had time. If I were to complete this project for a second time I would take additional 
                time on the front end to create a more thorough design plan and storyboard before beginning development.

            <p>This course was created using a free trial of Articulate Rise outside of a class or work context to learn more about the program.
                It was an individual project in which I was the sole contributor.  </p>

            <br>
                1. Demonstrate understanding of the history of genetics by correctly answering true/false style questions on an in course knowledge check.
            <br>
                2. Identify the key components that make up the structure of DNA and correctly label them on a diagram. 
            <br>
                3. Correctly identify the relationship between protein, DNA, and RNA by answering multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions on an in course knowledge check.
            <br>
                4. Apply knowledge of DNA to a real life scenario through completion of case study challenge.</p>

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
                <p class="main_link">This project represents an understanding of LTD goal #1 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objectives 1.1-1.3)</strong></a> because it shows the ability to 
                    design and develop an interactive that effectively meets learning objectives. It also demonstrates the progression of project management skills. Throughout the process of creating this course, I discovered a need for a better organizational and storyboarding 
                    strategy. Because it was my first experience using Articulate Rise, I was excited to get started and jumped into 
                    building my course without a storyboard or plan to follow. I created several versions of the content that I 
                    ended up deleting, and this cost me a lot of time. This ultimately resulted in my free trial ending without 
                    the completion of the project. Though the project was just for fun, it was still a disappointing result after all 
                    the work I put in. In the future, I plan to take more time on the front end to develop my ideas before jumping 
                    into the fun of course creation. I fully intend to complete building this course at some point and hope to 
                    implement better time management and planning strategies based on what I’ve learned.
