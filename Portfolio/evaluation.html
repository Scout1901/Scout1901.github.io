            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>The artifact below is a research proposal submitted for a Research Methods course. I was the sole contributor to this project. 
                The project proposes research on the effects of combining different dissection modalities (such as virtual and physical labs) 
                on the academic achievement of students. It includes a literature review, proposed research methods, a data analysis plan, 
                and a timeline for the proposed research project.  
            </p>

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p class="main_link">This artifact demonstrates an understanding of 
                LTD goal #2 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objective 2.1)</strong></a> by showing the ability to collect and summarize research within educational technology and apply
                that theoretical knowledge to future research ideas and opportunities for learning.Building this research proposal was the first time I've truly thought through the entire research process from start to finish. 
                Previously, I had only taken part in pieces of the research process- data collection, a literature review, some data analysis. 
                Writing this proposal has given me a more realistic perspective of the entire research process from start to finish, and provided me 
                with greater respect for the amount of effort that goes into getting a research study published in an academic journal. I found
                that narrowing down a topic was one of the most difficult aspects of this project for me. Should I complete another research proposal
                I will take care to let my review of literature guide my topical decisions.

            <h3>Portfolio Prototype User Testing</h3>

            <h4>Description:</h4>

            <p>This artifact represents the initial user testing I did on this portfolio website when taking my first web development course.

            <h4>Project Reflection:</h4>

            <p class="main_link">This artifact aligns with LTD program goal #2 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objective 2.2)</strong></a> by demonstrating an understanding of how to collect and analyze
                data in order to improve systems. The completion of this user testing report gave me insight into the experience that users had when visiting my website. It
                allowed me to identify many different issues, some I was aware of and others that I had not realized existed. The user 
                testing process has helped me to significantly improve the experience that users have when visiting my portfolio. In the future
                I hope to complete additional user testing to further improve the visitor experience.

            <h3>Geo-Holo User Testing Report</h3>

            <img class="random-pic" src="Projects/Project Images/geo1.png">

            <h4>Description:</h4>

            <p>This user testing report was completed as part of a group game design project. Our team created a prototype for a game about the fundamentals of geology for a faculty client at the 
                University of Missouri, and this was the report on our first round of user testing. Each team member collected data, designated in the report by group member names. Our group 
                then compiled our information together and wrote a summary of our findings together.  
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Project Reflection:</h4>

            <p class="main_link">This report aligns with LTD program goal #2 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objective 2.2)</strong></a> by showcasing the ability to create and execute a 
            survey for data collection and the ability to use the information gathered to improve learning outcomes in a serious game. 
            The completion of user testing for the Geo-Holo prototype provided our team with valuable information to help improve our game for both our client and our intended users. We were able to
            find errors in instruction clarity, identify problems with content delivery, and gain excellent insight into the way that players experience our game. When playtesting games in the future I hope to 
            include a larger pool of testers to receive more data to analyze. Additionally, I would like to playtest more frequently throughout the game design process.
