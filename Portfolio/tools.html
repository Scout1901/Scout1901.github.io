            <h2>Project Description</h2>

            <p>The artifact below represents a semester-long group project in an Instructional Systems Design course. Our group was tasked with identifying a community need and addressing it
                utilizing the ADDIE Instructional Design Model. Our team completed each step of the design process to
                develop a training program for teachers based on the needs of the educators surveyed. In this project,
                an in-depth analysis of the problem and needs, learners, context, and tasks was conducted leading to
                the development of an instructional training program and assessment plan designed to assist teachers
                with integrating and implementing technology in the classroom.

            <h2>Project Reflection</h2>

            <p>This artifact demonstrates an understanding of LTD program goal #3 (Objectives 3.1 & 3.2) because it required working within a team to identify a community need in educational technology 
                and exploring the complex social and technical concerns of the audience affected by the identified challenges. Additionally, this project demonstrates the ability to utilize reflection on 
                the relationship between technology and society to create a solution for a real-world problem.  
                This project was perhaps one of the most important projects of my academic career. Following the ADDIE model provided me and my group
                members with a comprehensive look at the design of instructional systems. I learned to apply the concepts learned in this course and others to a real-world scenario. I learned
                to analyze needs and learners, create objectives based on evidence, as well as analyze contextual variables and tasks. I gained experience designing instruction to meet an identified
                need, and creating materials to compliment our design. Additionally, I was able to practice creating a comprehensive assessment plan and developing the tools to collect data. The 
                learning I gained from this project applies to every type of learning design project I may encounter in the future! Our group struggled the most with organizing and delegating tasks
                among members. We also struggled to narrow down our training content based on our needs assessment. Next time I complete a project like this I intend to prioritize group 
                communication to ensure that we are on the same page and organized to accomplish our goals.
