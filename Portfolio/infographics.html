            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>The infographic below was created using Canva to serve as a guide for my students, which quickly 
                and succinctly summarized the engineering design process. This is a concept I used extremely 
                in classes, but I could not find an infographic or poster that had the wording I wanted. 
                The infographic was created using Canva. It provides a quick description of the engineering 
                design process with the wording I wanted to present to my students. </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                The infographic below was created using Canva to demonstrate the concept of abstraction in Biology.

            <h2>Project Reflections</h2>

            <p>This projects align with LTD program goal #1 (objectives 1.1-1.3) because they demonstrates the ability to develop learning graphics that 
                take complex ideas and visually represents them in a digestable format for learners. These projects were two of my earliest experiences creating digital images using Canva. I discovered that I love the ease of use that Canva allows users.
                It's easy to choose from a variety of templates and offers an interface that is easy to navigate and includes features that make graphic design easy for novice
                users like myself. I have continued to use Canva to create images and diagrams for a variety of purposes including game art, graphics for 
                design documentation, and even the buttons for this website. In creating projects of this nature in the future, I would love to explore similar editors (such as Polotno Studio) and compare
                the features they offer users compared to Canva.
