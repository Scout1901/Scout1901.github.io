            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>An solo project created using Construct 3 for a graduate level course in learning game design.</p>

            <p>Fossil Quest is a simulation style game that invites players to journey through time and help preserve a
                rare dinosaur for future generations. Fossil Quest seeks to enhance players' cognitive skills through the application of rules-based
                knowledge. Simulated role play and examples are used to teach players the conceptual relationship
                between factors that affect fossilization (such as oxygen, pressure, environment, and specimen
                composition) and the preservation of a specimen.

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p class="main_link">
                This artifact represents LTD learning goal #1 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objectives 1.1-1.3)</strong></a> by demonstrating the design and development of serious game, showing project
                management skills, and highlighting documentation skills. This was my first large project working with Construct 3, and with 
                that newness came a steep learning curve. The most insightful thing I learned from completing this project is that designing an 
                educational game to meet a specific learning objective, particularly one that seeks to meet a higher level learning goal, is much more complicated
                than it seems. Using a game to teach players to create, analyze, or evaluate is a difficult goal. Assessing those skills during gameplay adds a whole other level of complexity. 
                The project has inspired me to learn more about how to apply higher level learning objectives to game design, and to explore creative ways to assess that players 
                are actually learning.  I found that coming up with an initial idea and learning objectives for this game, and tying those objectives to assessment was both the most valuable portion of the design process and the most frustrating.
                I most enjoyed the pieces of the design process that allowed me to be creative such as developing a narrative, characters, and setting for my games.

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>A group project created using Construct 3 for a graduate level course in learning game design. My contributions to this project
               included prototype development, aligning assessment methods with learning objectives, and conceptual design assistance. 
            </p>

            <p>Geo-Holo is a serious game that will help to reinforce the learning objectives presented in an introductory 
                level undergraduate geology course at the University of Missouri. 
               Four learning objectives were identified by our faculty client 
                and our team worked to develop a game to engage learners in exploring these objectives. In Geo-Holo, 
                players are tasked with collecting dinosaur fossils for a new museum using futuristic technology. 
                In the process, the players will learn about basic geologic principles.

            <h3>Project Reflections</h3>

            <p class="main_link">
                This project demonstrates an understanding of LTD learning goal #1 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objectives 1.1-1.3)</strong></a> because it represents the start-to-finish design
                and development of a serious game as well project management skills. This project was particularly impactful because it enabled me to work with a team to journey through 
                the game design process. Our team was successful at working together to brainstorm ideas given our objectives, as well as storyboarding and prototyping our ideas. 
                We completed several quick cycles of prototype building, internal group testing, and revisions that worked well for us to move our project forward.  The main improvement our team 
                could have made to our process would have been to get more feedback from our client about our ideas/concepts as we were going through this process. I think that extra insight could have proved very valuable, and may 
                have impacted our final design.

                Chemistry in Life is a simulation style game that invites players to explore changes in
                everyday objects and analyze and interpret their findings to determine if a chemical or
                physical change has occurred.

                a 3D learning game. While still in the very early phases of design/development, this project has helped me learn more
                about the incorporation of design in a 3D environment. My main goal for working on this project was to increase my familiarity with 
                Unity, and I feel like I accomplished that. I hope that continuing to familiarize myself with what is possible using game engines will help me to bring my designs to 
                life and help me to understand how design and development must work together.

                "To Catch a (Food) Thief" is a serious game designed as part of a pre-lab assignment for introductory Biology students 
                to complete before they perform an electrophoresis lab in person. Prior to game assignment they 
                will have read through the preparatory lab materials, and have a basic understanding of the process 
                of electrophoresis and its role in Biological study.

                a lot throughout the process of making it. First, I learned the importance of narratives in game design. Second, I gained insight 
                into combining assessment with the mechanics of an interactive narrative maker like Twine. Both of these are lessons I will take with me as I 
                work on future projects.

                This artifact represents LTD learning goal #1 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objectives 1.1-1.3)</strong></a> by demonstrating the ability to design and develop 
                a 3D game. While this is a simple game with no learning goals it was still very helpful for me in learning more about Unity as a game engine.
                My main goal with this project, as with the Chemistry in Life project above, was to increase my familiarity with 
                Unity. Struggling to understand Unity from scratch and going through the process of creating simple code helped me to 
                both appreciate the development process and have a better idea of how development and design merge to create a final product.
