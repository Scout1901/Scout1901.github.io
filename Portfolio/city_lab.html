            <h3>Description</h3>
           
            <p>City Lab is an educational job program created to teach Tulsa Public Schools students to identify real-world problems, propose solutions, and present ideas 
                within a design-thinking framework. City Lab provides opportunities for students to build leadership skills, engage creatively, and develop STEM practices 
                to better prepare them for the challenges of college, career, and young adult life. The Program Proposal and Virtual Facilitation guide linked below were written by 
                myself and a co-worker. The program proposal demonstrates our project management strategy for developing the City Lab program from scratch. It includes our program goals 
                and competencies, a theoretical framework and rationale for our program decisions, and program design details. In addition, the proposal includes a logic model, as well as 
                scaling and management plans. The Virtual Facilitation Guide was created as a guide for adult leaders participating in our first two-week Summer 2020 program. It includes a 
                detailed schedule, curriculum, and activity guides. Both the program proposal and virtual facilitation guide were created using Google G Suite tools, primarily Docs and Sheets.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>

            <P>Participation in the creation of the City Lab program taught me an incredible amount about project management. It was amazing to see a program go from an idea to a full blown 
                successful project that will continue to help serve students in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area for years to come! This project was full of challenges including shifting our program 
                design from in-person to virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic, technology barriers, and mid-program schedule rewrites because of student progress. If I were to take part in the 
                next installation of City Lab, I would do several things differently based on what we learned along the way. I would ensure that the schedule listed in the Facilitation Guide 
                allowed for more flexibility and student input, place more emphasis on pre-session data collection protocol, and work on developing a recruitment plan that would ensure a more 
                diverse group of students representative of the Tulsa area.
            </P>
