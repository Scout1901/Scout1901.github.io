            <h3>Introduction and Learning Objective</h3>

            <p>
                The purpose of this image is to introduce students to gecko foot structure and function. This image 
                is the digital image portion of my individual final project for Introduction to Digital Media ISLT 7361. The final 
                digital media product will teach students about gecko foot structures and how they enable geckos to
                adhere to surfaces.
                <br>
                <p>Image Learning Objective: <em>Students will be able to identify the key structures of gecko feet when given a sample photo of 
                a gecko’s foot.</em> </p>
            </p>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Elements</h3>

            <p>I used contrast in my learning diagram by making sure that the text, images, and other shapes were 
                easy to read against the background I chose. I also demonstrated contrast by ensuring that my title 
                was significantly bigger in font size than the other diagram text. I utilized repetition by using a 
                consistent font, and arrow style, and by using repeating colors throughout (green and black). Alignment 
                was accounted for by making sure that the title was center-aligned, that my vector image text was 
                aligned properly with the shape of the raster image, and that the gecko images were aligned with the 
                same orientation. I used proximity in my learning diagram by ensuring that each label was located 
                close to the corresponding image and by making sure that any subtext was near it’s 
                parent text. These design elements support my student learning outcome by ensuring that the labels 
                were clear, readable, and attached to the correct part of the image. This will help students to easily 
                and quickly identify the key parts of gecko foot anatomy. 
            </p>

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
            
            <p>
                Completing this project helped me to gain a better understanding of the role of digital images in 
                education. I had never tried to tie a digital image to a learning objective before this project. I 
                had used images as supplements to teaching, but never as the basis for meeting a specific learning 
                objective. I think that the process of learning to stop and think through an objective before 
                beginning a project will prove invaluable in completing any future digital media work for learning. 
                It helps provide a grounding and purpose for your digital work that I wouldn’t have developed otherwise. 
                <br>
                Completing this project also helped me to learn the distinction between raster and vector images, 
                and when to use each. I am looking forward to taking the raster and vector techniques I learned in 
                Photoshop and Illustrator throughout these modules to develop more digital images! The basic image 
                manipulation skills, the design principle overviews, and learning objective creation involved with this 
                project helped me to understand just how powerful a well-designed digital image can be at conveying 
                information to learners.

            <h2>SketchBook Examples</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>The examples below are images of a variety of scientific illustrations that I’ve created. 
                As a teacher, I was frustrated by the lack of cute drawings of scientific concepts and creatures available 
                through creative commons licensing. I decided to create some of my own images for use in future 
                science course building. These illustrations were created, drawn, and edited using the SketchBook 
                app for iPad and a drawing stylus.

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p>The artifacts above represent time spent being creative and expressing science in a way that I enjoy. While 
                the process of creating them was fun, I have a lot to learn when it comes to designing and developing digital media projects. 
                The technical proficiency of the projects could be improved greatly through more practice and time spent using these tools. 
                Through working on these projects I’ve learned that I need to invest additional effort into learning to use digital media tools, 
                and basic art/drawing techniques if I want to be truly satisfied with my finished products. I hope to continue to build these skills 
                throughout my career as art skills often come in handy while working on professional projects.</p>
