            <p><em>The artifacts below represent a portion of a semester long course in the Front End Analysis of Systems. All work was completed individually.</em> </p>

            <h3>Needs Assessment</h3>

            <h4>Description:</h4>

            <p>This needs assessment overview is a basic outline of the needs assessment procedure used to analyze an issue that presented 
                itself at a community college in Arkansas regarding the professional communication of students with internship supervisors. 
            </p>

            <ul class="main_link">
                <li>To view project click <a href="Projects/NeedsAssess.pdf" target="blank">here.</a></li>
                <li>To view survey click <a href="Projects/Survey.pdf" target="blank">here.</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Project Reflection:</h4>

            <p>This project was a great opportunity to apply class concepts to a real-world scenario. I was not aware of what a needs assessment was before completing
                this course. This experience taught me the incredible importance of evaluating the needs of a client before starting any work on a learning project. This particular example
                is a bit lacking in detail. In the future when I conduct needs assessments, I plan to expand upon the roles and responsibilities of all involved parties, delve further
                into the problems and needs of clients through additional information gathering, and build a clearer data collection plan.
            </p>

            <h3>Procedural Analysis</h3>

            <h4>Description:</h4>

            <p>This artifact represents an analysis of the procedures used for Biology students to view a pre-prepared specimen under
                a microscope. A procedural analysis such as this might be used in curriculum development for outlining the type of content
                a learner should be able to perform. 
            </p>

            <ul class="main_link">
                <li>To view project click <a href="Projects/ProcedAnalysis.pdf" target="blank">here.</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Project Reflection:</h4>

            <p>Conducting a procedural analysis turned out to be a far more in-depth process than expected. Making sure to outline all the steps
                the steps necessary to complete a task from the perspective of a novice learner of the topic was eye-opening. The creation of 
                this artifact helped me to practice empathizing with learners, a skill that is necessary for quality instructional design. If I were to 
                complete another procedural analysis such as this one I would make sure to test my results before implementing them into the curriculum 
                to ensure that all steps are clear and nothing important was left out of the analysis. 
            </p>

            <h3>Prerequisite Analysis</h3>

            <h4>Description:</h4>

            <p>The prerequisite analysis below represents a breakdown of the knowledge, skills, and rules that would be required for an introductory 
                Chemistry student to accomplish a higher level learning objective related to atomic structure. It depicts all lower 
                level objectives that an instructional designer would need to include in a curriculum that seeks to help a student achieve this objective.
            </p>

            <p><img src="Projects/Prereq.jpg" target="blank"></p>

            <h4>Project Reflection:</h4>

            <p>Creating this artifact gave me further insight into the process of curriculum design. Thinking through how 
                a designer should align content to provide an appropriate scaffold for students to reach a higher level learning objective 
                according to Bloom's Taxonomy was incredibly helpful. Learning the formal process of completing a prerequisite analysis
                will prove valuable for the design of any sort of learning product that seeks to aid the accomplishment of a complex goal.
