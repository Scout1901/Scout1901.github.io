            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p>The process of recording and editing this video helped me to gain a greater understanding of the methods used to create digital video for education. 
                The storyboarding process was helpful because it forced me to slow down and plan the details of my project before starting. I had previously underestimated 
                how important these pre-filming steps would be- particularly in an educational context. The act of planning out every detail including the shots, angles, and 
                motions I wanted to incorporate helped me to use my time effectively while filming, and helped me to make sure that my video included all of the necessary components 
                for learning. This storyboarding technique could be helpful for creating a variety of digital media! I was also excited to learn about the types of shots, angles, and 
                motions that are frequently used in videos, and how they might be applied. This opened my eyes to some of the techniques used in other educational videos I've watched! 
                Overall, I think that my project will support students in meeting my learning objective. I feel confident that students would be able to identify factors that help geckos 
                to stick to surfaces after watching this video.

            <h2>Star Formation Animation</h2>

                <a href="https://www.animaker.com/"><strong>Animaker</strong></a>

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p>This was my first every foray into the world of animation. I found the process to be mildly frustrating, but overall a great learning experience. Animaker was fairly intuitive;
                I found it somewhat similar to iMovie which I had used before. I think I did a fairly good job of portraying the content I wanted to in this video, but the animation itself 
                turned out mildly "clunky."" In order to build a better animated video next time I think I would need some additional training about using Animaker's tools to make the animation appear
                smoother and more natural. I would also like to learn more about ways to personalize scenes and characters.

                Individual project created using iMovie as part of a design challenge to create an analog version of an existing digital game. For more details about the game design, learning objectives, and game rules click
                <a href="Projects/Race to Zoombiniville (2).pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>. 
            </p>

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p>I enjoyed this design challenge thouroughly! I loved playing the game <em>Zoombinis</em> and the challenge of taking it from its normal digital form and tranforming it into an analog 
                game helped me to be creative and truly expore the ways in which players interact with games. I learned the importance of clear and concise instructions, and explored gamifying 
                mathematics, which was a new experience for me. If I were to design another analog game, I would make sure and incorporate playtesting early on in my design process. I did not incorporate
                this in my project, but it could have provided valuable information to achieve a better product.

                Individual project created using 
                <a href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a>
                as part of a course module on DNA. 
            </p>

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p>This was a small simple project completed on my own to explore the video creation functionalities available on Canva. In the process of creating a course on genetics I wanted a 
                video that conveyed interesting facts about DNA in a short visual. I couldn't find a royalty free video that existed like this so used Canva to create one with the information 
                I wanted to include. The platform was easy and enjoyable to use and I feel that my end product accomplished the goal I sought to achieve. If I were to make another video on this 
                platform I would try incorporating moving video and additional graphics to the final product.
