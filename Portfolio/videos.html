            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p class="main_link">This artifact demonstrates an understanding of LTD learning goal #1 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objectives 1.1-1.3)</strong></a> by highlighting the ability to 
                create an educational video that meets learning objectives. The process of recording and editing this video helped me to gain a greater understanding of the methods used to create a digital video for education. 
                The storyboarding process was helpful because it forced me to slow down and plan the details of my project before starting. I had previously underestimated 
                how important these pre-filming steps would be, particularly in an educational context. The act of planning out every detail including the shots, angles, and 
                motions I wanted to incorporate helped me to use my time effectively while filming and helped me to make sure that my video included all of the necessary components 
                for learning. This storyboarding technique could be helpful for creating a variety of digital media products! I was also excited to learn about the types of shots, angles, and 
                motions that are frequently used in videos, and how they might be applied. This opened my eyes to some of the techniques used in other educational videos I've watched! 
                Overall, I think that my project will support students in meeting my learning objective. I feel confident that students would be able to identify factors that help geckos 
                to stick to surfaces after watching this video.

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p class="main_link">This project aligns with LTD learning goal #1 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objectives 1.1 & 1.2)</strong></a> because it demonstrates the design and development
                of an animated video to meet a learning objective. was my first ever foray into the world of animation. I found the process to be mildly frustrating, but overall a great learning experience. Animaker was fairly intuitive;
                I found it somewhat similar to iMovie which I had used before. I think I did a fairly good job of portraying the content I wanted to in this video, but the animation itself 
                turned out mildly "clunky." To build a better animated video next time I think I would need some additional training about using Animaker's tools to make the animation appear
                smoother and more natural. I would also like to learn more about ways to personalize scenes and characters.

            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>

            <p class="main_link">This artifact shows an understanding of LTD learning goal #1 <a href="https://sislt.missouri.edu/edtech/#goals" target="blank"><strong>(objectives 1.1-1.3)</strong></a> by demonstrating the ability to 
                utilize an existing resource to create new educational content. I enjoyed this design challenge thoroughly! I loved playing the game <em>Zoombinis</em> and the challenge of taking it from its normal digital form and transforming it into an analog 
                game helped me to be creative and truly explore the ways in which players interact with games. I learned the importance of clear and concise instructions and explored gamifying 
                mathematics, which was a new experience for me. If I were to design another analog game, I would make sure and incorporate playtesting early on in my design process. I did not incorporate
                this in my project, but it could have provided valuable information to achieve a better product.

                an educational video to meet learning objectives. This was a small simple project completed on my own to explore the video creation functionalities available on Canva.  While I was creating a genetics course, I found that I wanted a 
                video that conveyed specific interesting facts about DNA in a short visual. I couldn't find a royalty-free video that existed like this so I used Canva to create one with the information 
                I wanted to be included. The platform was easy and enjoyable to use and I feel that my end product accomplished the goal I sought to achieve. If I were to make another video on this 
                platform I would try incorporating moving video and additional graphics into the final product.
