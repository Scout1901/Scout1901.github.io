    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello! I’m Erin Weaver, a student at the University of Missouri pursuing an Ed.S degree in Learning Technologies and Design. I'm <strong>passionate</strong> about creating engaging learning experiences in STEM.<br/> I've worked as a substitute teacher in Joplin, Missouri for the last 3 months. Before moving to Missouri, I worked at a community college in Oklahoma developing STEM programs for under-served high schools. It was an <em>incredible</em> opportunity to grow! Before that, I worked as a 7-12th grade science teacher in Arkansas. I got to teach everything from astronomy to biology. This job made me eager to build my <em>own</em> creative science content! I hold a M.S. degree in Psychology from Pittsburg State University. I also hold a Masters in Biology from Missouri State University. I hope to earn my Ed.S degree from Mizzou by 2022, and start a full time career in learning technology!</p>
