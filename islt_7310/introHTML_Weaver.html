     Hello! I’m Erin Weaver. This is my first semester at Mizzou. I’m working towards my Ed.S degree in Learning Technologies and Design.  I've worked as a substitute teacher in Joplin, Missouri for the last 3 months. Before moving to Missouri, I worked at Tulsa Community College in Oklahoma. I developed out-of-school time STEM programs in under-served high schools. Before that, I worked as a 7-12th grade science teacher in Arkansas. I got to teach everything from astronomy to biology! I have very little web application or development experience aside from designing basic websites using Weebly and Wix. I’m hoping to start building the skills I need to apply web development to my future career. I also hope to be able to create a great base for my graduate portfolio. My favorite hobbies are hiking, birdwatching, and drawing. I like to spend my free time hanging out with my family and taking care of my pets.
