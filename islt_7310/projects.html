                <p>
                    City Lab is an educational job program created to teach Tulsa Public Schools 
                    students to identify real-world problems, propose solutions, and present ideas within a design 
                    thinking framework. City Lab provides opportunities for students to build leadership skills, 
                    engage creatively, and develop STEM practices in order to better prepare them for the challenges 
                    of college, career, and young adult life.

                    The Program Proposal and Virtual Facilitation guide linked below were written by myself and a 
                    co-worker. The program proposal demonstrates our project management strategy for developing the 
                    City Lab program from scratch. It includes our program goals and competencies, a theoretical 
                    framework and rationale for our program decisions, and program design details. In addition, 
                    the proposal includes a logic model, as well as scaling and management plans. The Virtual 
                    Facilitation Guide was created as a guide for adult leaders participating in our first two week 
                    Summer 2020 program. It includes a detailed schedule, curriculum, and activity guides. Both the 
                    program proposal and virtual facilitation guide were created using Google G Suite tools, 
                    primarily Docs and Sheets.

                <p>
                    Participation in the creation of the City Lab program taught me an incredible
                    amount about project management. It was amazing to see a program go from an idea to a full blown 
                    successful project that will continue to help serve students in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area for years
                    to come! This project was full of challenges including shifting our program design from in-person to 
                    virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic, technology barriers, and mid-program schedule rewrites because 
                    of student progress. If I were to take part in the next installation of City Lab, I would do several 
                    things differently based on what we learned along the way. I would ensure that the schedule listed in 
                    the Facilitation Guide allowed for more flexibility and student input, place more emphasis on 
                    pre-session data collection protocol, and work on developing a recruitment plan that would ensure a 
                    more diverse group of students representative of the Tulsa area.

                    “The Building Blocks of Life” course found below in PDF form was developed 
                    to teach high school students about the role DNA plays in genetics. I made it independently of a 
                    class or work simply to test out course building software, and gain some experience using 
                    Articulate 360 through a free trial. Though unfinished, it currently includes five completed 
                    modules. The modules include a variety of written content, interactives, videos and short 
                    quizzes. The course was created using Articulate Rise. The video linked below is an example of 
                    a video I created to supplement material not in the written content. The video was made using 
                    Canva.

                <p>
                        Throughout the process of creating this course I discovered a 
                        need for a better organizational and storyboarding strategy. Because it was my 
                        first experience using Articulate Rise I was excited to get started and jumped into
                        building my course without a storyboard or plan to follow. I created several versions 
                        of the content that I ended up deleting, and this cost me a lot of time. This 
                        ultimately resulted in my free trial ending without completion of the project. 
                        Though the project was just for fun, it was still a disappointing result after all 
                        the work I put in. In the future, I plan to take more time on the front end to 
                        develop my ideas before jumping into the fun of course creation. I fully intend to 
                        complete building this course at some point and hope to implement better time 
                        management and planning strategies based on what I’ve learned.

                    <p>
                        I loved to use new forms of media while I was teaching 7-12th 
                        grade science. The infographic linked below was created to serve as a guide for my 
                        students, that quickly and succinctly summarized the engineering design process. This 
                        is a concept I used extremely often in classes, but I could not find an infographic 
                        or poster that had the wording I wanted. The infographic was created using Canva. It 
                        provides a quick description of the engineering design process with the wording I 
                        wanted to present to my students. The second artifact below is a 
                        PDF of a variety of scientific illustrations that I’ve created. I was frustrated by 
                        the lack of cute drawings of scientific concepts and creatures available through 
                        creative commons licensing, so I decided to create some of my own for use in future 
                        science course building. These illustrations were created, drawn, and edited using 
                        the SketchBook app for iPad and a drawing stylus.

                        The artifacts above represent time spent being creative and 
                        expressing science in a way that I enjoy. While the process of creating them was 
                        fun, I have a lot to learn when it comes to designing and developing digital media 
                        projects. The technical proficiency of the projects could be improved greatly through 
                        more practice and time spent using these tools. Through working on these projects I’ve 
                        learned that I need to invest additional effort into learning to use digital media 
                        tools, and in basic art/drawing techniques if I want to be truly satisfied with my 
                        finished products. I hope to continue to build these skills throughout my course of 
                        study at Mizzou.
