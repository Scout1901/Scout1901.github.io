            <h2>Introduction and Learning Objective</h2>

            <p>
                The purpose of this audio is to introduce students to factors that enable geckos to adhere to surfaces. 
                This audio file is the digital audio portion of my final project for Introduction to Digital Media ISLT 7361. 
                The final digital media product will teach students about gecko foot structures and how they enable geckos to
                adhere to surfaces.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Audio Learning Objective</h3>
                <em>Students will be able to identify factors that enable geckos to adhere to surfaces when given 
                    several possible options.</em>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            
            <p> 
                Completing this digital audio project helped me to think about the importance of 
                clarity in audio used for education. I learned through recording myself that my 
                words are not always as clear as I intended them to be. This can be a huge issue when trying 
                to use audio alone to help students meet a learning objective. A few skills that I was pleased  
                to learn were how to add effects to audio and how to splice different pieces of audio together. Knowing 
                how to add effects, fix background noise, as well as fade in and out gives audio a polished sound 
                that helps remove distractions to make meeting learning objectives easier. 

                My project supports my learning objective effectively because it provides all of the necessary 
                information students need to be able to complete the desired end task. However, when combined 
                with video in my final project, I think the effectiveness and depth of learning will increase. Overall, 
                this project was an excellent way to get an introduction to recording and manipulating audio clips. I 
                hope to learn more about additional effects and filters in the future, in order to improve the quality of
                audio projects.
