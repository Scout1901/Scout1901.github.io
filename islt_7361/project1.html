            <h2>Introduction and Learning Objective</h2>

            <p>
                The purpose of this image is to introduce students to gecko foot structure and function. This image 
                is the digital image portion of my final project for Introduction to Digital Media ISLT 7361. The final 
                digital media product will teach students about gecko foot structures and how they enable geckos 
                adhere to surfaces.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Image Learning Objective</h3>
                <em>Students will be able to identify the key structures of gecko feet when given a sample photo of 
                a gecko’s foot.</em> 
            </p>

            <h2>Techniques</h2>

            <h3>Basic Raster Techniques</h3>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Change image size</li>
                <li>Rotate image</li>
                <li>Adjust brightness and contrast</li>
                <li>Adjust color vibrancy</li>
                <li> Subtract from the selection using the lasso tool</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advanced Raster Tecniques</h3>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Replace a background with a layer mask</li>
                <li>Add objects by cloning</li>
                <li>Use brush tool to fine tune a selection</li>
                <li>Remove small objects</li>
                <li>Create a graphic shape</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Vector Techniques</h3>
            
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Create simple shape</li>
                <li>Draw simple line</li>
                <li>Combine shapes</li>
                <li>Add a line of text</li>
                <li>Format text</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advanced Raster Techniques</h3>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Place text on or inside a path</li>
                <li>Use paths or curves</li>
                <li>Draw with pencil tool</li>
                <li>Draw with curvature tool</li>
                <li>Edit paths and shapes</li>
                <li>Create color gradient</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design Elements</h2>

            <p>I used contrast in my learning diagram by making sure that the text, images, and other shapes were 
                easy to read against the background I chose. I also demonstrated contrast by ensuring that my title 
                was significantly bigger in font size then the other diagram text. I utilized repetition by using a 
                consistent font, arrow style, and by using repeating colors throughout (green and black). Alignment 
                was accounted for by making sure that the title was center aligned, that my vector image text was 
                aligned properly with the shape of the raster image, and that the gecko images were aligned with the 
                same orientation. I used proximity in my learning diagram by ensuring that each label was located 
                closely to the corresponding image and by making sure that any subtext was in close proximity to it’s 
                parent text. These design elements support my student learning outcome by ensuring that the labels 
                were clear, readable, and attached to the correct part of the image. This will help students to easily 
                and quickly identify the key parts of gecko foot anatomy.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            
            <p>
                Completing this project helped me to gain a better understanding of the role of digital images in 
                education. I had never tried to tie a digital image to a learning objective before this project. I 
                had used images as supplements to teaching, but never as the basis for meeting a specific learning 
                objective. I think that the process of learning to stop and think through an objective before 
                beginning a project will prove invaluable in completing any future digital media work for learning. 
                It helps provide a grounding and purpose for your digital work that I wouldn’t have developed otherwise. 
                <br>
                Completing this project also helped me to learn the distinction between raster and vector images, 
                and when to use each. I am looking forward to taking the raster and vector techniques I learned in 
                Photoshop and Illustrator throughout these modules to develop more digital images! The basic image 
                manipulation skills, the design principle overviews, and learning objective creation involved with this 
                project helped me to understand just how powerful a well designed digital image can be at conveying 
                information to learners.
